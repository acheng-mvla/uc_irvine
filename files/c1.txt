Dear Cognitive Scientists, 
Welcome to Madison for the 40th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science  Society! Our meeting brings together some of the most innovative and exciting  research in cognitive science. The program features exceptional plenary talks  by three leading international experts: Michael Kearns (University of  Pennsylvania), Matthew Botvinick (DeepMind), and Susan Gelman (University of  Michigan). It also includes two invited symposia aimed at showcasing the theme  for this year: Changing Minds.  
CogSci 2018 received 947 submissions, including 692 full papers, 212 member abstracts, 13 publication-based short papers, as well as 16 proposals for a  symposium, 9 for a workshop, and 6 for a tutorial. After a rigorous review process,  we selected 213 papers for oral presentation (23%), 280 papers for poster presentation (30%), 199 member abstracts for poster presentation, 13  publication-based talks, 12 symposia, 6 workshops, and 4 tutorials.  
We hope that you enjoy the program this year and the vibrant city of Madison,  the original 30 (now 77) square miles surrounded by reality. We invite you to take advantage of this time away from your daily lives to catch up on the latest  developments in the field and to deepen your appreciation of the amazing  research being done in Cognitive Science. We also invite you to consider how  our work may be a force for positive change back in the real world. We hope  you will take us up on these invitations, not just in the conference hall but also at  the Union Terrace, at the Saturday farmer’s market on the square, and at the many fine eating and drinking establishments nearby. 
Your Program Co-Chairs, 
Chuck Kalish (University of Wisconsin, Madison),  
Marina Rau (University of Wisconsin, Madison),  
Jerry Zhu (University of Wisconsin, Madison),  
Tim Rogers (University of Wisconsin, Madison)

Conference Awards 
Robert J. Glushko Dissertation Prizes 
The Cognitive Science Society and the Glushko-Samuelson Foundation award  up to five outstanding dissertation prizes in cognitive science each year. The  goals of these prizes are to increase the prominence of cognitive science and  encourage students to engage in interdisciplinary efforts to understand minds  and intelligent systems. The hope is that the prizes will recognize and honor  young researchers conducting ground-breaking research in cognitive science.  The eventual goal is to aid in efforts to bridge between the areas of cognitive  science and create theories of general interest to the multiple fields concerned  with scientifically understanding the nature of minds and intelligent systems.  Promoting a unified cognitive science is consistent with the belief that  understanding how minds work will require the synthesis of many different  empirical methods, formal tools, and analytic theories. 2011 was the inaugural  year of this prize, and a new competition is held annually. 
The 2018 recipients of the Robert J. Glushko Prizes for Outstanding Doctoral  Dissertations / Theses in Cognitive Science are listed below: 
Melody Dye – 2017 PhD thesis “Bridging Levels of Analysis: Learning, Information  Theory, and the Lexicon” from Indiana University 
Chaz Firestone – 2017 PhD thesis “Cognition Does Not Affect Perception” from  Yale University 
Sagi Jaffe-Dax – 2016 PhD thesis “Neural Basis and Computational Account for  Dyslexia” from Hebrew University of Jerusalem 
Eric Schulz – 2017 PhD thesis “Towards a Unifying Theory of Generalization” from  University College London 
Michelle Spierings – 2016 PhD thesis “The Music of Language: Exploring  Grammar, Prosody and Rhythm Perception” from Leiden University

Workshop Proposal: Contemporary Cognitive Approaches to Decision-Making

Keywords: Judgment and decision making; cognitive process,  computational models. 
Overview and significance 
The study of how people make judgments and decisions  began in cognitive science (the primary JDM conference lit erally was founded as a workshop at the Psychonomics con ference). However, over time the area of judgment and deci sion-making (JDM) has moved apart from its cognitive roots,  despite the high overlap in underlying research questions.  However, greater interaction between cognitive and JDM  research could yield benefits to both from cross-pollination  (Bartels and Johnson 2015), including in terms of methods,  types of relevant data and underlying questions. This work shop is designed to foster such interaction. The talks will ex plore some productive areas of overlap between cognitive  research and judgment and decision-making research. 
Workshop structure. We plan a one-day workshop com prising 12 talks, each approximately 25 minutes. We also  plan to have a one-hour panel discussion with all speakers on  opportunities for leveraging cognitive and computational ap proaches to make new advances on long-standing questions in  judgment and decision making. 
Organizers and Presenters 
Daniel Bartels (Organizer) is Associate Professor of Mar keting at the University of Chicago.  
Todd Gureckis (Organizer) is Associate Professor of Psy chology at New York Univeristy.  
Jennifer Trueblood (Organizer) is Assistant Professor of  Psychology at Vanderbilt Univeristy.  
Oleg Urminsky (Organizer) is Professor of Marketing at  the University of Chicago.  
Presentations 
Neil Stewart (Warwick Business School, Behavioral Sci ence) will discuss how machine-recorded data can be used  to study cognitive questions. One project uses transactions  from 180,000 individuals on a stockbroking platform, to show  that people frame outcomes at the level of individual days, splitting new investments 1/N over purchased stocks. Despite  1/N purchasing, the 1/N pattern is obscured by aggregation at  the portfolio-level frame---revealing that the frame is the in dividual purchase and not the portfolio. Another project uses supermarket purchase history from millions of customers to explore the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects in  real, every day purchases, and the implications for process  models of multi-alternative choice.  
Daniel Bartels will discuss how anchors and target  values differ, and how they relate to credit card pay ments. Reference points serve as targets, with motivational  properties, whereas anchors act as neutral starting points for  subsequent judgments. This distinction can lead to meaning ful differences in interpretation and generalization of results.  Through several experiments and examination of a large  credit card data set, we investigate this difference and find  that values on credit card statements can serve as motivating  target values that can be effective at increasing monthly  payments when constructed wisely. We find that credit card  users are able to select effective goals for themselves.  
Sudeep Bhatia (University of Pennsylvania, Psychology)  will discuss a project on the structure of decision models. We take more than 50 models of risky choice and more than  50 models of intertemporal choice, and computationally  measure model mimicry between each model pair in each  domain (2000+ computational tests, each with 100+ model  fits). With this we are able to uncover a metatheoretical struc ture for the universe of risky and intertemporal decision mod els, with discrete model clusters as well as complex model  hierarchies. The project is still underway but has already re vealed a number of interesting results. It is also a commentary  on the current state of decision modelling, and suggests a  number of new directions for the field.  
Oleg Urminsky will discuss what factors make decisions  seem more similar or different. While academic researchers  categorize decisions into literatures, less is known about how  lay people view types of decisions. We develop a framework  to predict when people will see decisions as similar or differ ent. Participants rate decisions on attributes identified in an  initial exploratory study as reasons for perceiving decisions as  different. Relating these attributes to perceived similarity of  decisions, we identify the key factors that make decisions  seem similar or different. We develop a framework for think ing empirically about generalizability in research, and discuss  the implications for people’s choices of decision strategies. 
Falk Lieder (UC Berkeley, Psychology) will discuss an  integrative framework for modeling and improving peo ple’s decision strategies. A substantial literature has demon strated systematic violations of expected utility theory, but the  underlying cognitive mechanisms are not well understood. I  present a theoretical framework that integrates the psycholog ical realism of heuristics and biases with the unifying power  and mathematical precision of normative principles. The as sumption that decision-makers should make optimal use of  their finite time and limited cognitive resources (resource 
1
rationality) yields an automatic method for deriving rational  heuristics from first principles. Combining this method with  process tracing allows us to answer descriptive, normative,  and prescriptive questions about people’s strategies for multi alternative risky choice and planning. I illustrate its utility for  characterizing and quantifying the irrationality of decision  strategies relative to a realistic normative standard. Prelimi nary results suggest that deriving and teaching rational heuris tics is promising for improving decision-making. 
Paula Parpart (University College London, Computa tional Decision Making) will reinterpret heuristics as  Bayesian inference. Simple heuristics are typically regarded  as tractable decision strategies because they ignore a great  deal of information in the input data. One puzzle has been  why simple heuristics can outperform more complex full information models, such as linear regression. I will demon strate that these less-is-more effects do not portray any inher ent advantages of ignoring information, but rather that dis carding information is never optimal (at the computational  level). I place heuristics into a Bayesian inference framework,  where popular heuristics are equivalent to Bayesian inference  under the limit of infinitely strong priors. Interestingly, down weighting information with the appropriate prior is always  preferable to entirely ignoring it. I will discuss recent work on  the idea that high covariance environments may be responsi ble for the success of many heuristics. 
Jennifer Trueblood will present work on computa tional models of dual process theory. Many phenome na in judgment and decision-making are often attributed  to the interaction of two systems of reasoning. While  these so-called dual process theories can explain many  types of behavior, they are rarely formalized as mathe matical or computational models. Rather, dual process  models are typically verbal theories, which are difficult  to conclusively evaluate or test. We present a dynamic  dual process model framework of risky decision-making  that provides an account of the timing and interaction of  the two systems and can explain both choice and re sponse time data. 
Jared Hotaling (University of New South Wales, Psy chology) will discuss the effects of outcome information  during sampling on decisions from experience. We inves tigated the roles of attention and memory in decisions from  experience by comparing decision procedures where mone tary value information is (a) present during sampling versus (b) revealed after sampling. In three experiments partici pants made a series of choices between pairs of risky gam bles represented as urns containing different mixtures of  blue and red balls, starting with a sample task before making  a consequential decision, and varying visual and auditory  salience. Individuals placed greater weight on rare events  when outcome values were absent during sampling. High lighting a rare reward increased its salience when outcome  values were present, but not when they were absent. Param eter estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian prospect theory  model supported the conclusion that value-absent choices  involved greater overweighting of rare events. 
Nick Reinholtz (University of Colorado Boulder, Mar keting) will discuss reasoning about numeric distribu tions. To make optimal decisions, people often need to  know aspects of a numerical distribution beyond its central  tendency. For example, optimal stopping requires under standing the dispersion of potential payoffs. I discuss how  people learn (or don’t learn) and use (or don’t use) distribu tional information in simple tasks. We find that participants  learn the central tendencies of two simultaneously encoun tered distributions with high accuracy, but show predictable  biases in learning about dispersion. This suggests a puzzle  about how people represent distributional information. 
Stephen Spiller (UCLA, Marketing) will discuss the dis tinction between beliefs about quality and preferences.  Two individuals considering the same set of alternatives often  hold discrepant beliefs about whether one alternative is objec tively better than the other as a matter of fact (an objective  value comparison), or whether the difference reflects a matter  of personal preference (a subjective value comparison). I ex amine how these beliefs relate to the attribute structure of the  underlying alternatives. This helps to address when choices  requiring tradeoffs may be regarded as objective value com parisons, which alternative comparisons are likely to covary,  and suggests individual differences that may account for  common judgments across attributes. 
Abby Sussman (University of Chicago, Marketing) will  present work on causal scope and judgment. Often, we  must make decisions about how to bring about a desired out come. Making these decisions, we frequently have infor mation about how broad a range of potential outcomes that  particular action could cause (e.g., a cold could cause sneez ing while the flu could cause sneezing, headache and fever).  We find that beliefs about which action will lead to a stronger  outcome varies predictably based on the action’s intentionali ty and valence. People believe the narrow scope action is  more powerful when it is intentional (vs. unintentional) and  when it is a cure (vs. a cause), and there is no interaction be tween the two. This research opens a line of inquiry into how  the scope of a cause can influence judgments and decisions.  
Hang Zhang (Peking University, Psychology) will pre sent a decision-theoretic model for the temporal dynamics  of visual priming effects. In visual priming tasks, partici pants respond to the identity of a visual target following a  prime. Three priming effects—positive priming, negative  priming, and oscillated priming—were observed and consid ered by previous theories as consequences of automatic sen sorimotor processes. Here we developed a decision-theoretic  model for the response time of visual priming tasks. The basic  idea is that the brain has a constantly updated, probabilistic  expectation for the arrival time and identity of the incoming  target, which determines the motor preparing rate at each moment and thus the response time in an adaptive way. The  model could quantitatively predict all three priming effects  and how they vary with the temporal structure of the envi ronment. It also offers new insights to a range of related phe nomena.

Workshop summary 
All cognitive systems, almost by definition, both gather information and use that information to make decisions –they explore and exploit. But there is an intrinsic tension between these two aspects of cognition. Exploration is costly – the resources that go towards information-seeking are not available for action. Moreover, actions have to be taken before all the relevant information is available. When should a cognitive system seek new information and when should it stop seeking information and simply decide how to act? How do people and other organisms resolve this tension between exploration and exploitation? Is there an optimal way of doing so? And how can systems be motivated to seek information when that pursuit is costly and the immediate utility of the information may not be apparent? 
Recently, a wide range of researchers from very different disciplines and traditions have begun to address these questions, and in particular, have used computational methods to characterize explore/exploit tensions. This workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, with expertise in neuroscience, computation, robotics, evolutionary biology, and developmental psychology to attempt to connect these separate literatures, draw some general conclusions, and forge a research path for the future. 
In reinforcement learning, researchers have used “multi-armed bandit” tasks to determine when learners switch from a more rewarding action to a less rewarding one in search of more information, and which switching techniques are optimal, and have also explored neural realizations of these procedures. In neuroscience and robotics, researchers have explored the way that reward 
systems might be adapted to incentivize new information as well as more standard types of reward, and have tried to characterize the neural bases of information-seeking and curiosity. In evolutionary biology researchers have used explore-exploit contrasts to characterize and explain differences among species, such as differences in life histories or differences in reliance on learning versus innate computations. And in cognitive development researchers have increasingly focused on children’s “active learning” the ways that they actively seek information in the environment. In particular, computational approaches quantifying information gain turn out to provide an interesting characterization of children’s exploratory behavior. Children are also characteristically exploratory – as evidenced in their play, for example, and childhood itself may be seen as a solution to explore-exploit trade-offs. 
The classic examples of information-seeking involve extracting information from the external world, as in curiosity-driven exploration. However, exploration can take place internally as well as externally. Learners have to trade-off internal forms of exploration, such as those involved in mental simulations, or in exploring the range of possible hypotheses to explain a pattern of data. Activities like pretend play, hypothetical or counterfactual thinking, simulation, and even fiction can be understood as forms of this kind of internal exploration. These more internal forms of exploration also come with substantial computational costs, which must be traded off against the benefits of more accurate actions. 
Questions about exploration and exploitation are also interestingly related to questions about variability and randomness. Exploration often involves the production of apparently random variability in behaviors or hypotheses. But different types of exploration may be more or less strategic or more or less random. At one extreme, a learner may carefully calculate exactly which actions are most 
3
likely to lead to an increase in information and evaluate whether that information will be useful or relevant for a particular decision. At the other extreme, a learner may simply become bored or habituated and randomly pursue new policies or test new hypotheses and observe the consequences. Again there may be interesting trade-offs between these strategies, and between the computational work that is required for strategic exploration and its benefits. It also appears plausible that children become more strategic over development. But the relation between these two types of exploration and their costs and benefits have yet to be explored. 
By bringing together researchers who would normally belong to different communities we hope to begin to answer this foundational set of questions about the nature of cognition. 
Workshop structure 
The workshop will feature well-known experts from different fields. The workshop will also invite poster submissions from the broader cognitive science community, with “poster teasers” flash talks and an opportunity to view new studies investigating exploration-exploitation. Additionally, the schedule has built in ample time for questions for mini-panels of each sub-area of exploration-exploitation, ensuring maximum opportunity for audience engagement.

Learning as program induction

Introduction 
This workshop will cover new work that casts human learning as program induction — i.e. learning of programs from data. The notion that the mind approximates rational (Bayesian) inference has had a strong influence on thinking in psychol ogy since the 1950s. In constrained scenarios, typical of psy chology experiments, people often behave in ways that ap proximate the dictates of probability theory. However, natu ral learning contexts are typically much more open-ended — there are often no clear limits on what is possible, and initial proposals often prove inadequate. This means that coming up with the right hypotheses and theories in the first place is often much harder than ruling among them. How do peo ple, and how can machines, expand their hypothesis spaces to generate wholly new ideas, plans and solutions? Recent work has begun to shed light on this problem via the idea that many aspects of learning can be better understood through the mathematics of program induction (Chater & Oaksford, 
2013; Lake, Salakhutdinov, & Tenenbaum, 2015). People are demonstrably able to compose hypotheses from parts (Goodman, Tenenbaum, Feldman, & Griffiths, 2008; Piantadosi, Tenenbaum, & Goodman, 2016; Schulz, Tenen baum, Duvenaud, Speekenbrink, & Gershman, 2017) and in crementally grow and adapt their models of the world (Bram ley, Dayan, Griffiths, & Lagnado, 2017). A number of re cent studies has formalized these abilities as program in duction, using algorithms that mix stochastic recombination of primitives with memoization and compression to explain data (Dechter, Malmaud, Adams, & Tenenbaum, 2013; El lis, Dechter, & Tenenbaum, 2015; Romano, Salles, Amalric, Dehaene, Sigman, & Figueria, 2017), ask informative ques tions (Rothe, Lake, & Gureckis, 2017), and support one- and few-shot-inferences (Lake et al., 2015). Program induction is also proving to be an important notion for understanding de velopment and learning through play (Sim & Xu, 2017) and the formation of geometric understanding about the physical world (Amalric, Wang, Pica, Figueira, Sigman, & Dehaene, 2017). 
Goal and scope 
The aim of our workshop is thus to bring together scientists who have a joint interest in how intelligent systems (humans or machines) can learn rich representations and action plans (expressable as programs) through observing and interacting 
with the world. We have invited leading researchers from cognitive science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence inter ested in the computational foundations of reasoning. 
In particular, our goal is to bring together researchers work ing on broad range of topics related to program induction so as to facilitate discussion and help this nascent but exciting research area mature into a powerful and general theory of learning. Key topics of discussion will include (but are not limited to): 
• How should we formalize and test different theories of pro gram induction in human cognition? 
• What is a good framework and what are good domains in which to benchmark progress in program induction in ma chine learning, and as a general theory of learning? 
• What can diverse fields such as linguistics, symbolic sys tems, computational logic, contribute to one another’s in dividual projects and the overarching theory? 
• What are the necessary ingredients for a compositional the ory of cognition? I.e., what primitives do people have? What modes of composition? Methods of compression? Learning-to-learn ability? 
• What experiments will help separate the unique predictions of program induction from those of traditional accounts of compositionality and conceptual change (cf. Bruner, Good now, & Austin, 1956)? 
Target audience 
This workshop dovetails neatly with this year’s focus on “change, learning, growth, and adaptation”. These key el ements of cognition are precisely those that have resisted Bayesian accounts, and those which learning as program in duction theories purport to explain. Our target audience is almost as broad as the conference as a whole — we expect this workshop to be of interest to psychologists, linguists, philosophers and machine learning researchers alike. More over, we feel that the interdisciplinary nature of our work shop will facilitate interactions between the diverse strands of research presented at CogSci that might otherwise remain bunkered in parallel sessions.

Objectives and Scope 
Dynamical Systems thinking has been influential in the  ways psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists  think about cognition and development. Growing out of an initial emphasis on motor behavior, dynamic field theory  (DFT) has applied the concept of dynamic activation fields  to address fundamental questions relating to cognition. Over  the last two decades, DFT has been applied to a range of  domains from basic processes of visual working memory  and the planning of eye movements, to more complex  cognitive processes such as word learning and executive  function. DFT provides important tools for linking cognition  with sensori-motor processes, linking timescales from in the-moment behavior to learning and development, and  linking levels of analysis between neural and behavioral  data. 
Dynamic neural fields are formalizations of how neural  populations represent the continuous dimensions that  characterize perceptual features, movements, and cognitive  decisions. Neural fields evolve dynamically under the  influence of inputs and neuronal interaction, generating  elementary forms of cognition through dynamical 
instabilities. DFT has served as a useful tool for not only  interpreting and predicting quantitative aspects of behavior,  but also interpreting and predicting quantitative aspects of  neural activation data. In this way, DFT explains how neural  dynamics give rise to cognition over multiple timescales.  The concepts of DFT establish links between brain and  behavior, helping to provide traction in the dialogue  between experimental paradigms and theory development.  Behavioral paradigms can be modeled with Dynamic Neural  Fields, deriving testable predictions that can be tested  against behavioral and neural data. 
One obstacle for researchers wishing to use DFT has been that the foundational concepts of DFT are distinct from the  standard way of thinking about cognition as comprised of  static components. The computational foundations of DFT  are also distinct from many traditional computational  frameworks that are popular in the fields of cognitive and 
developmental sciences. Thus, the mathematical and  technical skills required to make these concepts operational  are not part of the standard repertoire of cognitive scientists.  The goal of this tutorial is to provide the training and tools  to overcome this obstacle. We will provide a systematic  introduction to the central concepts of DFT and their  grounding in both Dynamical Systems concepts and  neurophysiology. We will discuss the concrete mathematical  implementation of these concepts in Dynamic Neural Field  models, giving all needed background and providing  participants with some hands-on experience using  interactive simulators in MATLAB. Finally, we will take  participants through selected, exemplary case studies in  which the concepts and associated models have been used to  ask questions about elementary forms of embodied  cognition and their development. 
A newly published book on Dynamic Neural Field  modeling, Dynamic Thinking: A Primer on Dynamic Field  Theory, covers these topics and more, with interactive  simulators available to give hands-on experience to readers. 
In this workshop, we will provide participants with the  background needed to think about cognition and  development from the perspective of DFT. Additionally, we  will take participants through the process of building and 
simulating to provide the foundation to begin applying  concepts from DFT to their own research.

Overview 
This full-day workshop focuses on Massive Online  Experiments (MOEs). MOEs have transformative potential,  as they effectively allow researchers to run hundreds of  experiments simultaneously (cf. Hartshorne & Germine,  2015; Reinecke & Gajos, 2014). The goal of the workshop  is to help a broad cross-section of cognitive scientists begin  to incorporate MOEs into their research. 
What are Massive Online Experiments? Massive Online  Experiments use samples of tens or hundreds of thousands  of volunteer subjects. Unlike standard online experiments  that recruit subjects through online labor markets like  Amazon Mechanical Turk or Prolific, MOEs are usually run  through researcher-developed websites like  gameswithwords.org, testmybrain.org, and labinthewild.org.  Subjects are unpaid volunteers who choose to participate  because the experiments are intrinsically motivating.  Experiments often take the form of a game or of a ”brain  test” that allows subjects to learn about themselves.  Durations are typically short (under 15 minutes), though  longer and/or longitudinal studies are possible.  
Why use Massive Online Experiments? The large,  demographically diverse set of volunteers that participate in  MOEs allow researchers to design experiments that are not  feasible in the traditional laboratory or online labor market  model. MOEs enable statistically powerful comparisons  across demographic variables like age, culture, and  education level. Previous MOEs have simultaneously  probed cross-cultural differences in domains such as moral  reasoning, personality, and aesthetic preferences (Bleidorn  et al., 2016; Gebauer et al., 2014; Reinecke & Gajos, 2014).  
Moreover, large samples allow researchers to test the  generalizability of findings across different theoretically relevant parameters by running dozens of experimental  variations simultaneously. When MOEs are combined with  modern statistical analyses such as multi-level modeling,  researchers can study generalization across large numbers of  subjects and items simultaneously (Baribault et al., 2017). 
The Challenges of Massive Online Experiments. There  are two major challenges to MOE adoption. First,  researchers are trained to think about experiments under the  constraints of the traditional laboratory approach. The  benefits of MOEs are only realized in full if the  experimental design is tailored to the format. Considerations  include both constraints — such as designing studies that  subjects are intrinsically motivated to complete — and also  the extraordinary opportunities that MOEs provide.  
The second set of challenges are technical. MOEs present an  additional layer of technical demands beyond a standard  online experiment. Researchers must host an entire virtual  laboratory to attract subjects. Studies may go viral, causing  substantial traffic spikes. Assignment of items or conditions  to subjects must be carefully done when there are tens of  thousands of items, since random assignment at that volume  will inevitably over- and under-sample some items. 
Workshop Format 
The workshop will be divided into four sessions. The first  session will provide a motivational overview: What are  MOEs, how do they work, and what are they good for? This  will consist of three talks: 
9
Massive Online Experiments: Challenges, history, and  prospects, Presenter: Joshua Hartshorne 
This talk will present the motivation for conducting MOEs  and how they can be used to address common limitations  and frustrations of in-lab experiments. I review and address  common concerns, such as limitations in available methods  and data quality. I also address the barriers to a more  widespread implementation of MOEs and preview some of  the emerging solutions, which will be covered in more detail  in the afternoon. 
Massive Online Experiments towards Population-level  Cognitive Science, Presenter: Laura Germine 
For this talk, I approach the applicability of MOEs for  addressing some of the biggest challenges in public health  research. First, MOEs help address issues such as power,  generalizability, and rapid translation that are critical  bottlenecks for health research. Second, MOEs open the  door to a new population-level science of cognition, which seeks to understand and characterize cognitive functioning  from the perspective of population-level individual  differences. Finally, I will argue that MOEs are not a  convenience for researchers, but rather an ethical imperative  towards building a robust and representative science of  cognition. 
Massive Online Experiments for Research Across  Demographic and Geographic Boundaries, Presenter:  Katharina Reinecke 
In this talk, I will show how MOEs can help overcome the  replicability crisis in cognitive science and related fields by  studying larger and more diverse populations than possible  in laboratory studies or in studies conducted on online labor  markets. I will discuss how offering participants  personalized feedback at the end of the study attracts people  with varying motivations for participating in such  experiments. The talk will also show how MOEs can be  mutually beneficial to both participants and researchers by  providing learning opportunities for participants as well as  reliable data quality for researchers.  
The second session will explore recent examples of MOEs  across a range of disciplines. This will include presentations  of work by Drs. Hartshorne, Germine, and Reinecke,  covering the fields of psycholinguistics, clinical psychology,  and human-computer interaction, respectively. Additional  presentations will be selected from an open call. Depending  on the number of presentations, they will take the form of  either a series of rapid oral presentations or a poster session.  The second session will conclude with an open panel  discussion and Q&A focused on the uses of MOEs. 
The two afternoon sessions will introduce participants to  technology for MOEs. The third session will focus on  jsPsych, a JavaScript framework for creating online studies  (de Leeuw, 2015). It can be used for both traditional online  and laboratory studies, as well as MOEs. Josh de Leeuw will provide a tutorial overview of how to use jsPsych for  online studies broadly. 
The fourth session will cover Pushkin. While jsPsych  addresses many basic needs for running experiments online,  Pushkin address the additional challenges of MOEs, such as  handling massive traffic fluctuations and efficiently  distributing large numbers of items across large numbers of  subjects. Pushkin provides many additional resources for  maintaining an Internet laboratory: a website template, an  interactive forum, social media integration, and the ability  for subjects to create an account (useful for longitudinal  studies, etc.). Mariela Jennings will provide a demonstration  and tutorial.  
The workshop will conclude with open discussion of the  challenges and benefits of adopting MOEs. The aim of this  discussion is to help attendees consider ways in which  MOEs could augment their own research, and help the  presenters better understand the needs of the cognitive  science community to guide future development efforts on  MOE technology and training.

Computational Methods and Systems for the Cognitive Modelling and Support of Creativity and Creative Problem Solving

Keywords: creative cognition; creative problem solving; com putational modelling; computational creativity; methods; intel ligent systems; assistive systems 
Workshop Proposal 
Computational creativity and human creativity [Finke et al., 1992, Boden, 2003] are fields modelled with different pro cesses, and evaluated with different methods. To bridge this interdisciplinary divide, we need to (i) disseminate and re fine existing computational methods for modelling cognitive processes, (ii) aim to implement more cognitive processes in computational creativity systems and (iii) set benchmarks of comparative evaluation between cognitive human and com putational systems [Oltet¸eanu et al., 2016,Pease et al., 2001]. 
Various computational methods might lend themselves bet ter to modelling cognitive processes - for example semantic networks might help model associativity processes, case base reasoning [Aamodt and Plaza, 1994] might help model cog nitive structured representations which admit variations, etc. Furthermore, various (a) computational models of cognitive process or (b) systems aiming at replicating cognitive pro cess results do exist: e.g. for analogy [Gentner, 1983,Falken hainer et al., 1989], metaphor, concept blending [Confalonieri et al., 2016a, Fauconnier and Turner, 1998] and concept in vention [Confalonieri et al., 2016b, Ontan˜on et al., 2012], in- ´ sight [Helie and Sun, 2010] etc. Also, various systems exist ´ that can perform well in human creativity tests, like the Re mote Associates Test [Mednick, 1962,Oltet¸eanu and Falomir, 2015] and the Alternative Uses test [Guilford, 1967,Oltet¸eanu and Falomir, 2016]. Other such computational cognitive sys tems show new possibilities in the improving control over current experimental design [Oltet¸eanu et al., 2017,Oltet¸eanu and Schultheis, 2017]. 
In this workshop we will discuss existing computational methods, systems and models, focusing on questions like the following: 
(i) what computational methods are more suitable for implementing computational models of creativity and problem solving, and computational systems supporting creativity and problem solving; 
(ii) what types of support can natural cognitive systems benefit from when performing creative problem solving and other creative acts; 
(iii) what kind of computational support has been offered so far, what kind of computational support can be offered with the existing techniques and approaches; 
(iv) to what extent computational methods must get closer to simulating or modeling cognitive process to make cog nitive support possible. 
Workshop Duration and Organization 
We propose a half-day workshop for the presentation, discus sion and elaboration of new computational methods and sys tems aimed to cognitively support creative problem solving and other creative processes. 
The workshop will involve three elements: 
(i) Four invited speakers will present existing methods and systems (details below). 
(ii) Short presentations of papers and posters will be accepted on the topic. 
(iii) The workshop will end with a panel discussion, focused on establishing future directions for methods and systems aimed at supporting creativity and problem solving.

This full day tutorial is an exposition of a rapidly growing new alternative approach to building computational models of cognition and decision based on quantum theory. The cognitive revolution that occurred in the 1960s was based on classical computational logic, and the connectionist/neural network movements of the 1970s were based on classical dynamical systems. These classical assumptions remain at the heart of both cognitive architecture and neural network theories, and they are so commonly and widely applied that we take them for granted and presume them to be true. What are these critical but hidden assumptions upon which all traditional theories rely? Quantum theory provides a fundamentally different approach to logic, reasoning, probabilistic inference, and dynamical systems. For example, quantum logic does not follow the distributive axiom of Boolean logic; quantum probabilities do not obey the disjunctive axiom of Kolmogorov probability; quantum reasoning does not obey the principle of monotonic reasoning. It turns out that humans do not obey these restrictions either, which is why we consider a quantum approach. In addition, quantum  contextuality has important and little known consequences  for the development of probabilistic models of cognitive  phenomena. 
This tutorial will provide an exposition of the basic assumptions of classical versus quantum theories. These basic assumptions will be examined, side-by-side, in a parallel and elementary manner. We will show that quantum theory provides a unified and powerful explanation for a wide variety of paradoxes found in human cognition and decision ranging from attitude, inference, causal reasoning, judgment and decision, and memory. This tutorial introduces and trains cognitive 
scientists on this promising new theoretical and modeling approach.

Participants Background 
This tutorial will introduce participants to an entirely new area and no previous experience or background with quantum theory will be assumed. No background in physics is required. In fact, except for a few simple examples to motivate the idea, little or no reference to physics will be made during main part of the tutorial. What is required is an elementary background in classical logic and probability. 
Material to be Covered 
1. Introduction and background (2 hours). First, we will examine major differences between classical versus quantum theories of probability. The concept of superposition isintroduced and distinguished from classical probability mixtures. The important issue of measurement in classical and quantum systems will be compared and examined. We will include several dramatic empirical examplesillustrating empirical violations of the classical laws of probability (e.g., conjunction, disjunction, and total probability) and the parsimonious explanation of all these violations by quantum theory. 
2. Quantum dynamics (2 hours). Next, we will examine the differences between classical and quantum dynamical systems. The basic idea of Markov processes will be introduced and compared with quantum processes. A parallel development of Markov and quantum cognitive  
models will be shown and applied to a concrete empirical example. In doing so, we will distinguish between classical  and quantum representations of a state and compare the effects of measurement on these states for Markov and quantum systems. A key goal is to show when and how quantum processes depart from Markov processes, and how we can empirically test whether a system is best  represented by a Markov or quantum framework.  
  
3. Quantum heuristics (2 hours) We introduce quantum logic and show that it addresses many of the issues arising in models based on classical logic. In particular,  we will demonstrate how several fast and frugal heuristics can be reconstructed by integrating them with a quantum logic structure. As part of this, we will introduce  the concepts of qubits, U-gates, and state evaluation and  how they can be used to model information processing that goes on when these strategies are executed. This approach opens a number of new questions and predictions, which we address b y reviewing existing literature on expertise, game theory, recognition memory, decision making under uncertainty, and the hindsight bias. The results suggest that integrating heuristics with a quantum logic structure can enhance the empirical accuracy of heuristics as well as ground quantum logic in psychological theory by giving it specific processing rules to implement. 
Quantum contextuality (1 hour) Models of a  phenomenon are often developed by examining it under different  experimental conditions, or measurement contexts. The resultant  
probabilistic models assume that the underlying random variables,  which define a measurable set of outcomes, can be defined  independent of the measurement context. The phenomenon is  deemed contextual when this assumption fails. Contextuality is an  important issue in quantum physics.  
However, there has been growing speculation that it manifests  outside the quantum realm with human cognition being a particularly  prominent area of investigation. This section of the tutorial aims to  first deliver a conceptual understanding of contextuality as well as  why it is relevant for cognitive scientists. Secondly, hypergraphs will  be introduced as a flexible, underlying theoretical framework which  allows experiments to modelled in modular way as well as  determining whether the phenomenon being examined is contextual. The theory will be illustrated with some simple examples expressed  in a probabilistic programming language which can be mapped to  hypergraphs. The section will conclude with some speculation on the  implications of contextuality for probabilistic modelling in cognitive  science.

Half Day Tutorial on Measuring Mindfulness Behaviorally: Onsite and Online Data  Collection with jsPsych

General Purpose  
This half day tutorial will introduce participants to breath  counting, a recent innovation in mindfulness research  methodology that offers the first opportunity to collect a  relatively direct behavioral measure of mindfulness  (Levinson et al., 2014). This tutorial will review the basics  of mindfulness practice before providing attendees with the  knowledge, skills, and tools required to implement breath  counting procedures in their own research. The widespread  adoption of this quantitative measure could positively  impact the field by offering a more straightforward and  transparent methodology that would improve the overall  consistency of mindfulness research across studies and  between investigators.  
Mindfulness Research: Technical Challenges  Although the quality of research has steadily improved,  perspectives on mindfulness may remain skewed among  scientists with exposure to past research of questionable  quality (see Ospina et al., 2007). Misgivings aside, the  scientific, clinical, and popular interest surrounding  mindfulness research remains strong, as an extensive list of  beneficial effects have been reported. Meta-analyses  focusing on more recent research suggest that some of these  effects may include: stress reduction; reductions in  symptoms and relapse rates of anxiety and depression;  improved physical functioning and quality of life (Gotink et  al., 2015); improved selective, sustained, and executive  attention capacities; enhanced working memory and  executive functioning (Chiesa, Calati, & Serretti, 2011);  reductions in anger, hostility, negative affect, and substance  use in prison populations (Shonin, Gordon, Slade, &  Griffiths 2013); and mitigation of age-related cognitive  decline (Gard, Hölzel, & Lazar, 2014). Although the authors  of these reviews are cautiously optimistic about the potential  benefits associated with practicing mindfulness, they  nevertheless raise methodological concerns about the  research, and are careful to report findings as preliminary.  Even the most well-designed and well-executed  investigations of mindfulness are typically dogged by two  major methodological hurdles: (1) data on the duration and  frequency of practice sessions are typically taken from self report measures, thus making it difficult to determine  
whether subjects have recorded their participation honestly  or accurately (Vettese et al., 2009), and (2) as mindfulness is  primarily an introspective task, individual differences in  practice session quality have historically been difficult to  measure.  
Measuring Mindfulness with Breath Counting  Breath counting is a simple technique that has been  recommended for centuries as a tool to help beginners  practice mindfulness effectively. The process typically  entails practitioners being given the basic instructions for  practicing mindfulness: to focus and attempt to hold their  attention on their breath, and then to return their attention to  the breath when they realize that their mind has wandered.  Although simple to explain, noticing that one’s attention has  wandered can be surprisingly difficult, as a striking amount  of time can pass between becoming distracted and becoming  aware of that fact. Counting one’s breaths facilitates the  recognition of mind-wandering episodes: beginners continue  paying attention to their breath, while also counting their  exhalations (in their heads) in cycles of 10; the tendency to  count consecutively occurs automatically when one is  distracted, and “hearing” numbers greater than 10 serves as  an easily-noticeable cue indicating that the mind has  wandered (at which point they redirect focus back to the  breath and begin a new count cycle). By slightly modifying  this breath-counting task—specifically by externalizing the  count in some form—mindfulness researchers can easily  record the frequency, duration, and approximate quality of  practice sessions for all subjects.  
Presenters  
Samuel Nordli and Thomas Gorman are doctoral students  working under Dr. Peter Todd and Dr. Robert Goldstone  (respectively) in the Department of Psychological and Brain  Sciences and the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana  University, Bloomington. Both presenters have years of  collective experience practicing and teaching mindfulness,  and have each conducted mindfulness experiments  specifically using the breath counting technique (e.g.,  Gorman & Green, 2016; Nordli & Todd, in prep.).  
Participant Background  
This tutorial will not assume any specific prior knowledge,  so no personal or professional background in mindfulness  
15
is required. The tutorial will feature the breath-counting  technique implemented in JavaScript (to facilitate online  data collection); prior experience with programming or  JavaScript is recommended but not required. 
Material to be Covered  
1. The first section will introduce the practical and  conceptual fundamentals of practicing mindfulness. The  presenters will briefly cover their personal backgrounds/ experiences with mindfulness in an attempt to convey  what they consider makes the practice compelling and  worthwhile, aside from the kinds of general effects that  are typically studied and reported in the literature (such as  stress reduction). Please note: although the practice of  mindfulness has its roots in the Buddhist tradition, the  entirety of this tutorial will reflect the completely secular  and scientific perspectives of the presenters. (20 min).  
2. Next we will discuss the technique of breath counting,  briefly reviewing its history and its rough practical  equivalence to mindfulness practice, before moving on to  explore how cognitive scientists can use a version of this  technique in order to easily gather a set of objective  behavioral measures that would otherwise be nearly  impossible to collect. (40 min).  
3. The tutorial will conclude with a hands-on demonstration  of the breath counting methodology, exploring and  manipulating a basic experimental design created with  jsPsych, a JavaScript library for creating web browser 
based behavioral experiments (de Leeuw, 2015).  Participants will be given the opportunity to adjust  experimental parameters and then observe the effects of  those adjustments (e.g., varying the number of breaths per  cycle, or the presence or absence of feedback or mind 
wandering probes). Finally, we will cover several  different methods of analyzing the breath counting data,  and discuss the pros and cons of the different metrics that  can be extracted from the data. (2 hr).

Tutorial: Mixed Models in R – An Applied Introduction 
Henrik Singmann (singmann@gmail.com) 
Department of Psychology, University of Zurich ¨ 
Binzmuhlestrasse 14/22, 8050 Zurich, Switzerland ¨ 
Keywords: statistical analyses; repeated-measures; mixed model; multilevel model; hierarchical model 
Significance of the topic 
In order to increase statistical power and precision, many data sets in cognitive science contain more than one data point from each unit of observation (e.g., participant), of ten across different experimental conditions. Such repeated measures pose a problem to most standard statistical pro cedures such as ordinary least-squares regression, (between subjects) ANOVA, or generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression) as these procedures assume that the data points are independent and identically distributed. In case of re peated measures, the independence assumption is expected to be violated. For example, observations coming from the same participant are usually correlated – they are more likely to be similar to each other than two observations coming from two different participants. 
The goal of this tutorial is to introduce a class of statis tical models that is able to account for most of the cases of non-independence that are typically encountered in cognitive science – linear mixed-effects models (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates, 2008), or mixed models for short. Mixed models are a generalization of ordinary regression that explicitly capture the dependency among data points via random-effects pa rameters. Compared to traditional analyses approaches that ignore these dependencies, mixed models provide more ac curate (and generalizable) estimates of the effects, improved statistical power, and non-inflated Type I errors (e.g., Barr, Levy, Scheepers, & Tily, 2013; Aarts, Verhage, Veenvliet, Dolan, & van der Sluis, 2014). 
In recent years, mixed models have become increasingly popular. One of the main reason for this is that a number of software packages have appeared that allow to estimate large classes of mixed models in a relatively convenient manner. The tutorial will focus on lme4 (Bates, Mchler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015), the gold standard for estimating mixed models in R (R Core Team, 2017). In addition, it will introduce the functionality of afex (Singmann, Bolker, Westfall, & Aust, 2017), which simplifies many aspects of using lme4, such as the calculation of p-values for mixed models. afex was specifically developed with a focus on factorial designs that are common in cognitive science. 
Despite a number of high impact publications that intro duce mixed models to a wide variety of audiences (e.g., Baayen et al., 2008; Judd, Westfall, & Kenny, 2012) the ap plication of mixed models in practice is far from trivial. Ap plying mixed models requires a number of steps and decisions that are not necessarily part of the methodological arsenal of 
every researcher. The goal of the workshop is to change this and to introduce mixed models in such a way that they can be effectively used and the results communicated. 
Structure of the workshop 
The workshop is split into two parts main parts and one inter lude. The focus of the first part is not on mixed models, but on the basic knowledge in statistical modeling with R that nec essary for competently using mixed models. The second part focuses exclusively on mixed models. It introduces the key concepts and simultaneously shows how to fit mixed models of increasing complexity. Each part will take approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes (not including breaks). The time between the two parts will be used to provide a short intro duction to the tidyverse (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017), a modern set of tools for data science in R that are especially useful in this context. A full overview over the topics in each part is given next. 
Versions of this workshop have already been presented, once at UC Berkeley (as part of the “Data on the Mind” work shop)1and once in Zurich (for graduate students and post docs). Therefore, preliminary versions of the workshop mate rial are already publicly available.2 These previous iterations have also shown that a full day is an appropriate duration that will allow participants to reach a level after which they can apply mixed models. 
Statistical Modeling The first part is intended to provide a general introduction to statistical modeling in R in terms of linear or generalized linear models. Specifically, the first part will provide a practical overview over the steps neces sary to perform a complete statistical analysis using ordinary regression or similar standard statistical models. The follow ing steps will be introduced: 
1. Identifying the appropriate probability distribution of ones’ data. For example, normal model versus binomial model (e.g., for accuracy data). 
2. The difference between dealing with continuous and cate gorical covariates (especially in interactions), different fac tor coding schemes, and how to set up model formulas. 3. Estimating models. 
4. Hypothesis tests of model terms (i.e., main effects and in teractions). 
5. Follow-up/post-hoc tests and custom contrasts. This sec tion will focus on the emmeans package (Lenth, 2018). The first part will end with a discussion on the limitations of most standard statistical models when repeated measures 
1http://www.dataonthemind.org/2017-workshop 
2https://github.com/singmann/mixed model workshop 17
are involved. This will set the stage to introduce the three basic approaches for handling repeated measures (e.g., Gel man & Hill, 2007): complete pooling, no pooling, and partial pooling. The first two pooling approaches are the traditional methods for dealing with repeated-measures. Complete pool ing ignores variability coming from sampling multiple units of observation (e.g., data is simply aggregated across partic ipants and thereby individual variability ignored), whereas no pooling ignores all similarity across units of observation (e.g., a separate model is estimated for to the data of each participant). Partial pooling is the hierarchical approach im plemented in mixed models which takes both variability as well as similarity across units of observation into account. 
Interlude The interlude will introduce the tidyverse (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017), specifically packages tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2, and broom. Those will be used to perform a no pooling analyses of a repeated measures data set introduced at the end of part 1. 
Mixed Models The goal of the second part if to introduce the concepts necessary to specify and estimate mixed models. The following topics will be discussed: 
1. Partial pooling and the distinction between fixed-effects and random-effects. 
2. How to specify the correct random-effects structure. Here we will first introduce the notion of the maximal random effects structure (Barr et al., 2013). Then we will dis cuss alternative views suggesting model selection for this goal (e.g., Matuschek, Kliegl, Vasishth, Baayen, & Bates, 2017). 
3. How to deal with convergence problems. 
4. Different methods for testing terms in mixed models: Kenward-Roger approximation, Satterthwaite approxima tion, likelihood-ratio tests, and parametric bootstrap. 
5. Mixed-models with alternative distributional assumptions (e.g., binomial models). 
If time permits, part 2 will also provide an overview of different ways of visualizing mixed models and discuss the problem of calculating effect sizes or pseudo effect sizes for mixed models. Pointers to R packages that allow the estima tion of mixed models within a Bayesian statistical framework are also provided. 
Participation Requirements Attendees are expected to have a basic knowledge of R. For example, attendees should be able to load their data into R, calculate some summary statistics, estimate a linear regression on their data, and cre ate some basic plots.

Statistics as Pottery: Bayesian Data Analysis using Probabilistic Programs (Tutorial) 
Michael Henry Tessler (mhtessler@stanford.edu), Noah D. Goodman (ngoodman@stanford.edu) Department of Psychology, Stanford University 
Abstract 
Probability theory is the “logic of science” (Jaynes, 2003) and Bayesian data analysis (BDA) is the glue that brings that logic to data. BDA is a general, flexible alternative to standard statis tical approaches (e.g., NHST) that provides the scientist with clarity and ease to address their personal scientific questions. Doing BDA in a probabilistic programming language (PPL) af fords several additional advantages: a compositional approach to writing models, separation of model specification from al gorithmic implementation (a la lm() in R), and continuity from articulating data analytic models to Bayesian cognitive mod els. Furthermore, specifying one’s model and data analysis in a PPL allows you to search for “optimal experiments” for free. This tutorial will walk the participant through the basics of BDA to state-of-the-art applications, using an interactive on line web-book and tools for integrating BDA into their existing workflow. 
Keywords: bayesian data analysis; bayesian cognitive modeling; probabilistic programming 
Significance 
Learning statistics is like learning pottery. With pottery, you can learn how to make different shapes (e.g., a bowl, a vase, a spoon) without understanding general principles. Another way is to learn the basic strokes of forming pottery (e.g., how to mold a curved surface, a flat surface, long pointy things). In this course, we are going to learn the basic strokes of statis tics by building generative models of data. We’ll compose these strokes to make shapes you’ve seen before (e.g., a linear model), some shapes you’ve probably never seen before (e.g., a single model of a two-alternative forced-choice task and a three-alternative task), and explore how you would make new shapes if you needed to. We won’t learn what tests apply to what data types but instead foster the ability to reason through data analysis. We will do this through the lens of Bayesian statistics, though the basic ideas will aid your understanding of classical (frequentist) statistics as well. 
Bayesian data analysis (BDA) is a general-purpose, flexi ble data analytic approach for drawing inferences about hy potheses from data. Recent years have elucidated the short comings of the “classical” statistical framework—Null Hy pothesis Significance Testing (NHST). NHST is opaque and rife with assumptions the scientist is often forced to adopt, which is partially credited for the reproducibility crises in psychology and related fields. BDA provides a principled al ternative to NHST: Intuitive conclusions are drawn from intu itive, explicit assumptions. Major journals have made public their openness to alternatives to NHST (e.g., Lindsay, 2015), and Bayesian techniques are precisely that alternative. 
For many years, BDA was a specialist’s methodology be cause it required advanced computational skills to implement 
and fit Bayesian models. No longer: Probabilistic program ming languages (PPLs) abstract away nuisance details and allow one to build models from scratch in few lines of code; they further provide black-box inference algorithms that can be used with little expertise. PPLs are programming lan guages have special operators for representing probabilities and randomness. Crucially, they provide an abstraction bar rier between model specification (what we wish to compute) and the algorithm for returning the result (how we try to com pute it), analogous to how the function lm() (in the program ming language R) runs a linear model: The user simply spec ifies the functional form of the regression model (e.g., addi tive, interactive,...) and, under the hood, computation is done to return the answer. The PPL approach enhances the trans parency of a model, which in turn allows the scientist to rea son through and revise the model more easily. 
PPLs are more than just a single model, however, they are full-blown programming languages that allow you to build any model you might need. Strange data types or experiment designs that violate assumptions of classical tests are no prob lem; all you have to do is be explicit about how you believe the data were generated (e.g., in the simplest case, that two experimental conditions gave rise to potentially different dis tributions of responses). If your hypothesis can be made more precise, PPLs provide an avenue to formalize it in a cognitive model. Have a cognitive model in hand but can’t think of a way to precisely integrate it with the raw behavioral data? You could build a simple regression model to take your pre dictors (predictions of the cognitive model) into the appropri ate data space. All of this can be achieved without leaving the same language. This kind of open-ended model specification cannot be achieved using probabilistic libraries or restricted probabilistic languages (e.g, STAN, BUGS). 
State-of-the-art data analytic technologies are to be found in PPLs. For example, with a formal model in hand, one can automatically search for good experiments to run (i.e., exper iments that, regardless of their outcome, strongly update your beliefs about a scientific question) using “optimal experiment design” (OED). OED searches from a space of possible ex periments for those that distinguish a scientist’s alternatives models. OED has been implemented in the PPL that this course will use (Ouyang, Tessler, Ly, & Goodman, 2016), and we will introduce the system at the end of the course. 
This tutorial will be of broad interest to the Cognitive Sci ence community because it touches upon a variety of distinct but related topics in the empirical disciplines. Foremost, it is a tutorial in modern data analysis and modeling, assum ing no background knowledge of either Bayesian statistics or 
19
probabilistic programming. By learning how to create sim ple Bayesian models in a PPL, participants will more easily grasp the relationship between the generative process of the data and the inferences drawn from observed data. Second, we draw the connection between simple data-analytic mod els (e.g., regression models) and Bayesian cognitive mod els, fostering an integrative theoretical view of data analysis and modeling. Finally, we demonstrate the power of explicit data modeling by showing how Optimal Experiment Design comes for free once a Bayesian data analysis has been cho sen. Throughout, we show participants how to incorporate this kind of modeling into their everyday scientific workflow. By the end of the tutorial, participants will be able to 
1. Build Bayesian statistical models for simple and complex problems using a probabilistic programming language 2. Interpret the various components of such a model in terms of one’s scientific hypotheses 
3. Relate Bayesian models to more orthodox statistical mod els (e.g., a linear model) 
4. Defend a particular model specification (priors, likelihood) in a way that other cognitive scientists will understand

This symposium on Event-Predictive Cognition (EPCog) will scrutinize the apparent strong linkage between events and predictions. Events, characterized as “a segment of time at a given location that is conceived by an observer to have a beginning and an end” (p.3, Zacks & Tversky, 2001), seem to be predictively encoded in our minds, linking and temporarily binding the essential aspects that constitute an event. How ever, in different disciplines the concept of an event as well as of predictions and predictive encodings has been treated from different perspectives and by means of different paradigms. 
The EPCog symposium brings together cognitive scien tists, who are experts in developmental, cognitive, and neuro computational psychology, linguistics, machine learning, and neuroscience. The overall goal is to foster an interdisciplinary knowledge exchange about the connections between predic tions, event processing, event encodings, including their de velopment, as well as closely related computational modeling approaches. Questions addressed to varying extents from dif ferent (inter)disciplinary perspectives in all talks are: 
• Is there a common principled encoding of events? • How do predictions unfold while processing events? • Are predictions critical for developing event encodings and hierarchical encodings thereof? 
• How do non-linguistic event encodings interact with lan guage? 
• How are predictive event encodings related to working and long-term memory? 
• How do predictive event encodings interact with anticipa tory behavior and cognition? 
Event-related cognitive science questions, such as how hu mans apprehend, perceive, encode, and process events as well how events interact with behavior and cognition, have been addressed by cognitive scientists for decades. The percep tion of simple behavioral events, such as walking, grasp ing, or throwing, has been studied with biological motion perception paradigms beginning in the 1970s, if not earlier (Johansson, 1973). Similarly, linguistics has acknowledged from early on a close relation of sentences as event descrip tors – with agents and patients constituting the main involved entities and the verb describing an event progression or an event situation (cf. e.g. Jackendoff, 2002). In fact, it appears 
that language is closely related to how we structure events cognitively (Papafragou, 2015). Language abilities seem to be grounded in and develop from pre-linguistic, conceptual structures of events, including implicit knowledge about our own body, our own behavioral abilities, physics and particu larly objects, the abilities of others, and social behavior. 
Somewhat more recently, these conceptual analyses have developed into deeper theoretical analyses and cognitive the ories. Two influential theories in cognitive psychology have focused on the behavioral and perceptual relevance of events. Closely related to the ideomotor principle, which dates back to the 19th century, the theory of event coding (Hommel, Musseler, Aschersleben, & Prinz, 2001) postulates that our ¨ mind tends to develop common codes between motor activi ties and their contingent sensory effects. These event codes then enable the goal-directed motor activation when desiring the associated sensory effects – essentially developing com pact sensorimotor event codes. Focusing more on the per ceptual side, event segmentation theory postulates that hu mans encoded events compactly in memory and somewhat differentiate event encodings from event transition encod ings, which link events to each other over time (Zacks, Speer, Swallow, Braver, & Reynolds, 2007). Over the last two decades, these two theories have intensively studied, verify ing the high adaptability and flexibility of event codes as well as its relevance with respect to memorization and prediction. 
Concurrently, the predictive mind, predictive encodings, and anticipatory behavior have been studied as key concepts for the development and pursuance of higher level cognitive abilities, including action and language (cf. e.g. Butz & Kut ter, 2017; Cooper, 2010; Engel, Friston, & Kragic, 2016). This predictive mind perspective essentially suggests that we develop abstract thoughts and language from systematically and actively exploring and processing continuous sensory and sensorimotor streams of information. Moreover, we do so in an active, anticipatory manner, in that desired anticipated future states selectively invoke those actions and (believed) consequences, where “desired” refers to both, a motivational desire towards internal homeostasis as well as an information theoretic desire towards improved world knowledge (cf e.g. Friston, 2009). 
21
It remains unclear, however, how our mind properly ab stracts these streams of information into symbolizable, con ceptual units of cognition. How are these units encoded to en able their recombination in compositionally meaningful man ners? Contemporary models of action selection that consider event knowledge for invoking control (e.g. Cooper, Ruh, & Mareschal, 2014; Gumbsch, Otte, & Butz, 2017) only pro vide limited solutions. Yet understanding the involved ab straction processes, the resulting abstract encodings, and their compositional recombination is critical when aiming to un derstand the human mind. 
Putting this together, event-predictive cognition (EPCog) may be a key to develop compositionally recombinable con ceptual structures as well as to understand the development of the human mind from a functional and computational perspective (Butz, 2016; Butz & Kutter, 2017). Event predictive encodings may enable higher-level cognition, such as episodic memory and language, integrating various per cepts, dynamics, and actions into consistent wholes. EPCog may explain how a continuous sensorimotor stream can be transformed into discrete, high-level, conceptual representa tions, which are compositionally recombinable. 
Our four renowned contributing speakers will set the stage for a highly interesting and productive knowledge exchange and discussion on events, predictions, and cognition as well as their close interrelations. 
• Rick Cooper will apply a neurocomputational modeling approach to address the challenge of abstracting concep tual event structures from sensorimotor information. He will argue that a fundamental purpose of such event struc tures is to preempt errors of action, and will demonstrate how abstracted event structures may be used by cognitive monitoring processes to trigger proactive control and re planning, thereby avoiding error. 
• Jeff Elman has studied language processing and modeled it with recurrent neural networks for several decades. In his presentation with Ken McRae (based on Elman & McRae, 2017) he will focus on the temporal structure of events rep resentations, its potentially hierarchical nature, and under lying common encodings using modeling and large-scale norming studies of event protocols. 
• Anna Papafragou focuses on cognitive and linguistic as pects of event representations, as well as on the develop ment of event perception and processing in children. She will address the nature of event representations while pro cessing particular events as well as while producing lin guistic event descriptions. 
• Jeff Zacks relates the perception and processing of events directly to prediction error processing, episodic memory, and action planning (Richmond & Zacks, 2017). An event is viewed as a currently active (predictive) code in work ing memory, which is updated when error spikes are de tected. Moreover, he addresses the potential for applying the gained theoretical insights for treating memory disor ders.

Introduction 
Cognitive research on visual and multimodal narratives has  been burgeoning in the last decade. An increasing number of  researchers in the psychological sciences have turned to  examining sequential images from a variety of  subdisciplines, particularly those from fields of linguistics  (Cohn, 2013a), discourse studies (Magliano, Larson, Higgs,  & Loschky, 2015), the perceptual sciences (Foulsham,  Wybrow, & Cohn, 2016; Loschky, Hutson, Smith, Smith, &  Magliano, In press), and the cognitive neurosciences (Cohn,  Paczynski, Jackendoff, Holcomb, & Kuperberg, 2012). 
This broad coverage by different subfields of the cognitive  sciences is testament to how complex sequential images can  be, especially when they combine in multimodal interactions,  such as with text. Indeed, visual narratives have proven to be  a good testing-ground for many facets of basic cognition.  
The presentations in this symposium highlight several  emerging lines of research on visual narratives in the  cognitive sciences, spanning across the subfields of  psycholinguistics, scene perception, cognitive neuroscience,  and clinical psychology. 
Changes in attentional breadth while viewing  visual narratives: A test of the Scene  Perception & Event Comprehension Theory  (SPECT) 
The first presentation by Lester C. Loschky, Ryan V.  Ringer, Maverick E. Smith, John P. Hutson, Heather R.  Bailey, Jeffrey M. Zacks, and Joseph P. Magliano examines visual narratives from the perspective of scene  perception and event cognition. We tested a novel hypothesis  of the Scene Perception & Event Comprehension Theory  (SPECT) (Loschky, et al., In press) regarding the relationship  between front-end processes, which operate during single eye  fixations (e.g., attentional selection), and back-end processes,  which occur across fixations in memory (e.g., shifting to  build a new event model), while viewing visual narratives.  Event perception research has shown better memory for  objects fixated at event boundaries than event middles. Scene  perception research suggests a potential connection between  
memory at event boundaries and attentional breadth. During  the first two seconds of picture viewing, viewers make long  saccades and short fixations (ambient mode), but by 4-6  seconds, they make short saccades and long fixations (focal  mode). Viewers’ average saccade length measures the extent  of their overt visual attention. Integrating these findings,  SPECT proposes that visual attention broadens at event  boundaries and then narrows in the middles. We tested this  hypothesis in two lines of research. First, we used picture  stories similar to comics, except one views the narrative  sequence one picture at a time. One group of viewers  segmented 6 picture stories, and another group viewed them  while we tracked their eyes (overt attention). Viewers  remained in the ambient mode longer while viewing pictures  at normative event boundaries than middles. Second, we had  participants view videos of everyday events while  performing the gaze-contingent useful field of view visual  discrimination task to measure their covert attentional  breadth at normative event boundaries and middles. Around event boundaries, viewers’ attention expanded, then  narrowed toward the middles, consistent with SPECT’s  hypothesis. Thus, using both overt and covert attention  measures, in picture stories and everyday event videos, we  supported SPECT’s hypothesis in visual narratives. 
Complexity in Visual Narrative Grammar  
Recent work by Neil Cohn on visual narrative has posited  that sequential images draw on a Visual Narrative Grammar  (VNG) that uses similar principles to linguistic syntax, only  at a discourse level of semantics (Cohn, 2013b). Early  empirical work on VNG sought to establish the validity of  basic constructs such as distributionality of narrative  categories, constituent structure, and the independence of  narrative structure from semantics. In addition, studies of the  electrophysiology of the brain using event-related potentials  have implicated similar neural responses to the manipulation  of narrative and semantics as to syntax (P600, LAN) and  semantics (N400) in sentence processing (Cohn, Jackendoff,  Holcomb, & Kuperberg, 2014; Cohn et al., 2012). Here, we  focus on a new stage of research which looks at additional  hallmarks of syntactic structure in narrative grammar:  relationships of units and constituents across distance  dependencies, such as those where the same content may be  rearranged to yield a different structure. Such work shows  
23
further that sequential image comprehension extends beyond  juxtaposed semantic relationships between images, and  highlights the “syntactic” nature of narrative grammar.  
The online processing of multimodal narratives While there is a large body of work on traditional text  narratives, and growing work on wordless visual narratives,  there is relatively little on the comprehension of multimodal  narratives, where text and images combine. This presentation  by Aidan Osterby, Neil Cohn, Lester C. Loschky, and  Joseph P. Magliano examines the interaction between  sequential images and text. Cohn (2016) proposed a  framework in which multimodal relationships are classified  based on whether one or both modalities convey the primary  meaning, and whether one or both modalities contain a  necessary structural ordering, or grammar. The current study  explores “co-assertive” cases—when both modalities balance  their expression of meaning, and both use a grammatical  structure. Here, we present two experiments which examine  the self-paced viewing times to participants who were shown  comics strips that modulate their structural contributions of  text and images—via deletion and reordering of neither, one, or both modalities. Our findings support that text-image  interactions balance relationships beyond meaning alone, and  such work provides initial support for examining these  complex multimodal interactions in systematic ways. 
The roles of semantic relatedness and narrative  structure in narrative comprehension in  individuals with ASD 
The final presentation by Elizabeth O’Donnell, Neil  Cohn, and Emily Coderre examines visual narratives from  a different perspective, by examining the comprehension  abilities of a different population. Individuals with autism  spectrum disorders (ASD) often struggle with narrative  comprehension. Such difficulties could arise from impaired  semantic processing and/or impaired grammatical  processing, both of which have been documented in this  population. Most studies investigating semantic processing  and grammatical comprehension have used written or spoken  sentences or narratives; yet language deficits are also  documented in ASD, which may confound results. This  makes visual narratives an ideal venue for investigating more  global aspects of narrative comprehension in this population.  In previous work we have shown that semantic processing is  impaired for both linguistic and visual narratives in ASD (Coderre et al., Under Review). It remains to be seen,  however, whether narrative comprehension difficulties might  also stem from impairments in structural sequencing abilities  that are required for narrative comprehension. We investigate  semantic and structural (grammatical) processing in non linguistic narrative comprehension to determine the relative  contributions of each to the purported impairments in  narrative comprehension in individuals with ASD. To do so  we replicate a previous study of sequential image  comprehension (Cohn et al., 2012) in a population of adults  
with ASD and typically-developing (TD) adults. Stimuli  consist of normal sequences (containing both structure and  meaning); semantic-only sequences (containing meaning  between panels but no narrative structure); structural-only  sequences (containing a narrative structure but no semantic  relatedness); and scrambled sequences (randomly-ordered  panels with neither semantic relatedness nor narrative  structure). Semantic processing is evaluated by comparing  the effect of sequence type on the N400 component of the  event-related potential (ERP), while structural processing is  evaluated via the left anterior negativity (LAN) effect.  Preliminary results will be discussed with respect to patterns  of semantic and structural processing both within and  between groups. This work offers a novel insight into  mechanisms of narrative comprehension in ASD.

Background 
The acoustic world is variable and messy. Signals that allow listeners to identify and/or disambiguate important auditory objects (an unusual rustle of leaves in a darkening forest, your winning bingo number) will likely share many acoustic characteristics with othersoundsin the environment. What is more, the most diagnostic auditory dimensions for detecting the ominously rustling leaves or categorizing a crucial syllable may be obscured, distorted, or missing. Just as often, the diagnostic acoustic dimensions may change completely across contexts. 
These challenges are ubiquitous in speech comprehension. People talk with different accents, different speaking rates, different vocal tracts, and often at the same time. A talker may turn away from you in the middle of a conversation, and then decide to whisper the most intriguing part of their sentence, so as not to be overheard by the person they are talking about. Or, worse yet, the talker may imitate the very different and distinct voice of the object of conversation.  Each of these cases dramatically changes the character, usefulness, and significance of the acoustic dimensions available for speech comprehension. 
This variability and context-dependence in the mapping between acoustic dimensions and the identity or significance of a sound segment means that an 'acoustical fingerprint' computational approach that has been so successful in recognizing recorded music even in degraded recordings and noisy backgrounds (Wang, 2003) may not be very successful for humans or machines trying to perceive and understand natural speech in everyday environments. 
Thus, a basic problem is discovering the acoustic dimensions that allow for speech decoding. In particular, the listener must track parameters of speech-relevant acoustic dimensions, so that the information they provide for speech decoding can be appropriately weighted. This information includes 1) a dimension's validity (how strong is the mapping between variability across an auditory dimension, and sound identity or category?); 2) its availability (how often is that dimension encountered); 3) its redundancy (how much informational overlap is there between this dimension and others?); 4) its salience (to what degree do the basic acoustics of the dimension attract exogenous attention); and 5) its cost (how difficult is it to perceive the dimension, or extract its underlying statistics?). 
Crucially, the values of these parameters vary widely as a function of acoustic and linguistic context. For example, whereas the pitch of some speech segments is a secondary cue to in quiet environments, its role is much greater in noise. Therefore, the listener must dynamically reweight the informative acoustic dimensions, taking into account the context-specific modulation of these parameters to maximize the likelihood of recovering the talker's intended message.  
Viewed this way, speech and non-speech auditory recognition and categorization can be thought to involve dynamic perceptual reweighting of multiple auditory dimensions across different timescales (Francis & Nusbaum, 2002; Heald & Nusbaum, 2014; Idemaru & Holt, 2014). By extension, proficient speech comprehension can be modelled - at least in part - as becoming skilled in modulating the attentional gain to specific auditory dimensions, and doing so in a context-sensitive way. This theoretical approach takes advantage of advances in understanding the acquisition of expert visual skills, and also relies on the decades of research in both human and non-human animals that listeners adjust 
25
their reliance on different dimensions on a moment-by moment basis (Shamma & Fritz, 2014). It is also complementary to, and informed by, a number of theoretical models (functionalist, probabilistic, Bayesian, cue integration) that emphasize the dynamic and probabilistic nature of language processing and speech perception (e.g., Bates & MacWhinney, 1989; Kleinschmidt & Jaeger, 2015; McClelland & Elman, 1986; McMurray & Jongman, 2011; 
In this symposium, we sketch out a framework for approaching speech perception as a process of dimension based auditory attention. 
First, Lori Holt reviews the evidence for the ubiquity of context-informed perceptual reweighting in multiple speech domains, showing that listeners are not only sensitive to the validity, availability, redundancy, salience, and cost of auditory dimensions that are diagnostic for sound identity or category, but that they adjust their use of these dimensions based on multiple, dimension-specific contextual cues on a moment-to-moment basis. 
Second, Howard Nusbaum discusses how the acquisition of perceptual expertise is shaped by context and cognitive mechanisms of working memory and attention. To this point, conceptually framing auditory processing as a skill rather than a native ability (as speech perception is often characterized) opens the way to investigate how feedback from the environment about success in achieving perceptual goals can work to shape attention dynamically in and for different contexts. 
Third, Fred Dick reviews ongoing behavioral and neuroimaging research from our laboratories that examines both associative and causal relationships between general auditory attentional and speech comprehension skills. In particular, he focuses on what candidate mechanisms might be involved at different stages of learning and transfer between non-speech and speech, and how short- or long-term shifts in the informational parameters of a given dimension (in particular validity and salience) might drive representational change. 
Fourth, Neeraj Sharma reports on how current machine perception models for speech recognition reweight acoustic dimensions, whether they use similar strategies as reported for humans, and what mechanisms or metaphors machine and human perceptual approaches might profitably borrow from each other. 
Finally, Barbara Shinn-Cunningham lays out key similarities and differences in the way that object- and dimension-selective attention appear to play out in audition and vision.
